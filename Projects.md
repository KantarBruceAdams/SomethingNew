#### [Kano Computer Kit](https://kano.me/store/us/products/computer-kit)
* "It's a computer that anyone can make". A computer wherein all the hardware and software can be assembled & explored, with the goal of enabling children to learn about computers & programming through explorative tinkering. The Operating System (and everything else) can be augmented and modified through a high level visual programming model.

#### [Lively Kernel](https://www.lively-kernel.org/)
* [Dan Ingalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ingalls)' Operating System that promotes the creation of software entites through [direct manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface) of visual objects, and supports live-editing of the underlying code of the system and all entites. Developed entirely in JavaScript, and runs in the browser.

#### [JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/)
* Development Environment that facilitates the creation of custom [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)s and [Projectional Editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor) (aka ["Language Oriented Programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming)). The idea is to create the ideal languages & representations (UI) for each thing.

#### [Human Advancement Research Community (HARC)](http://harc.ycr.org/)
* "HARC, part of Y Combinator Research, has the mission to ensure human wisdom exceeds human power, by inventing technology that allows all humans to see further and understand more deeply"
* Hosts multiple projects for new ways of programming, modeling, authoring, augmented reality, etc.

#### [Intentional Domain Workbench](http://www.intentsoft.com/intentional-technology/)
* Programming model based on editing code directly in [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) form with strong references
* Created by Charles Simonyi, president of [Intentional Software](http://www.intentsoft.com/), former head of Microsoft's application software group

#### [PyxiSystems Boxer](http://www.pyxisystems.com)
* Visual language ("Computational Environment") designed as a successor to Logo, with the same educational goals in mind. The aim is to make learning easier and more rewarding, especially over the long term.

#### [TUNES Operating System](http://tunes.org/cliki/)
* An attempt to rethink the concept of "Operating System" in terms of higher level abstractions
