Dear "fonc" community,

This is to notify you that this mailing list ("fonc") will be retired and made inactive at the end of this month.
<br/>VPRIs focus and efforts have shifted and we will no longer host or support this list.
<br/>Thanks for your past interest, support and participation.

No, sorry…..I suppose if someone in the community wanted to start something up they’d be more than welcome.  Activity had dropped to almost nothing in the past year…..

Brilliant, thank you Kenny!

Kim, is there a similar way to keep in touch with the latest developments of VPRI and HARC?

You leave the rather intriguing comment that

> VPRIs focus and efforts have shifted and we will no longer host or support this list.

What have the focus and efforts of VPRI shifted to? Is this related to the
<br/>completion of the STEPS project or is that old news?

I only found out about FoNC, VPRI, heck even the untold story of OOP, less
<br/>than a year ago, and the stuff you're all working on is incredible. It's
<br/>pretty criminal how little-known it is, but I joined because I believe in
<br/>what you're doing and want to see what's going on.

It's a shame that there's not been much activity in 2016 and 17 - but from
<br/>my limited expeditions into the depths of the archives, there seems to be
<br/>a real wealth of useful info that isn't present anywhere else. So huge
<br/>thanks to Kenny Friedman for setting up the new list and archive mirror;
<br/>it'd be a bit sad to join a group just as it's about to disband! :)

There will be some more news in the near future, but I can tell you
<br/>that many of us moved to a Lab called Communications Design Group and
<br/>then to HARC at Y Combinator Research.  Yes, the focus had shifted
<br/>that these points.

The web home is: http://harc.ycr.org  The set of researchers
<br/>is impressive and interesting.  I'm familiar with the GP
<br/>project, and several others are worth of a deeper looker.
<br/>I'm especially interested in the tutoring system.

Hi all,

Over the last 4 years, I too have stumbled upon "the untold story of oop", VPRI, and a number of other "untold" histories of software and efforts to make it more open-ended & human-oriented. I can tell you that FONC is not the only attempt at such a thing.

If I'm not the only one, maybe we can benefit from sharing what we've found (or collaborate on projects or ideas or resources), rather than just limiting to the COLA stuff.

I myself have taken from many sources (like the ones listed below) to develop my own user-oriented software innovation

Is anyone interested?

Examples:
- Intentional Domain Workbench,
- Meta Programming System,
- Lively Kernel,
- https://youtu.be/1O8PwkXfDJg
- (and the following are all on worrydream.com)
  - The Humane Representation of Thought,
  - Drawing Dynamic Visualizations,
  - Learnable Programming

----

Joel Jakubovic
<br/>30 July 2017

Interested? Absolutely. I recognise the Lively Kernel, and I found Bret
<br/>Victor shortly after discovering this place. But I hadn't come across the
<br/>other things you mentioned; thanks for those.

I was really pleased to see the Apparatus Editor thing (aprt.us) at the
<br/>HARC website. Previously, it was really frustrating that Bret Victor's
<br/>array of magic tools existed only in his talks, but now there is an online
<br/>implementation to play with and study. And the rest of the projects seem
<br/>to be the continuation of several VPRI threads, which is reassuring to
<br/>see.

I agree with you about discussing more than just the COLAs. Are there
<br/>rules for the discussion group about what the focus is? (I haven't
<br/>participated in a mailing list before, so I apologise if I'm making rookie
<br/>mistakes as to the form or content of my replies - please tell me if
<br/>anything's wrong!)

> I can tell you that FONC is not the only attempt at such a thing.

VPRI, or soon-to-be HARC, does seem to be the only organised body of
<br/>people working on this stuff though - I assume that's what you were
<br/>talking about? What little else I've seen is the work of individuals like
<br/>Bret Victor, or the person in the talk you linked to.

By the way, I think I must have come across your GitHub account a few
<br/>weeks ago - I was looking at https://github.com/d-cook/Objects, and I've
<br/>been feeling the urge to do something similar. I think I have the same end
<br/>goal (don't we all), but instead of bootstrapping from JavaScript, I want
<br/>to start with an empty OS process, and hopefully have some sort of
<br/>self-modifying visual editor.

In the same way that the Piumarta and Warth devised the Id object model to
<br/>be the 'minimal' generator, so to speak, of an OO system, why not consider
<br/>the question of what the minimal generator for *direct manipulation* would
<br/>look like - in contrast to the traditional boostrapping method of
<br/>developing textual languages. I want to *begin* with direct manipulation
<br/>of memory and machine instructions, as early as possible -  rather than
<br/>starting with textual programming languages and parsing, adding direct
<br/>manipulation later.  I'd just find it more pleasant to implement the
<br/>object model in a more visually-aided way. What do you think?

Finally, I just wanted to mention the ominous message on the FONC wiki:

> We are faced with a need for significant action and the odds are stacked
> <br/>against us. Invention receives no attention, and innovation (even when
> <br/>incorrectly understood) receives lip service in the press but no
> <br/>current-day vehicle exists to to nurture it.

I suppose I can always go back to this whenever I need a chill down the
<br/>spine and a sense of pressing urgency in life! Anyone else wonder if, at
<br/>some point in the future, society will be so dependent on computer
<br/>software ... that some random null pointer dereference will bring down the
<br/>entirety of civilisation?

First things first: I suggest we find a place to host collaborative materials and discussion. It's probably more important to have somewhere soon than to have somewhat perfect (we can fix that later)

Siggestions:
- google hangouts
- google groups
- github
- cemetech.net (might seem like an odd target community, but there are many creative minds there, exploring all kinds of topics)

One thing I'd like is a list of goals, motivations, and means or mechanisms, and from there we can see where our ideas & materials overlap or differ, and perhaps refine how to approach these things better. Also of value may be what else we can do to promote new ideas and ways of thinking (& doing) in the larger community (industry, education, organizations). I've been trying to promote a subset of ideas at work, but it's hard for most developers to think outside of their mechanical (rather than humanistic) view of software. I'm having some luck appealing to the User Experience (UX) team though, so we'll see where that goes.

In response to some questions I've had:

I agree about promoting the user model above (or instead of) a textual one. My bootstrap approach is a means to create an underlying execution model that could change itself and later be subsumed by a UI. I was going to forego parsing and a REPL and just "brute force" a UI that will allow further development to be done visually; but since I'm starting with code, I'm having a hard time feeling like those things wouldn't make my life easier just to GET to that point.

On the other hand, I've found an applicable reason for such a tool at work, for which I'm STARTING with the UI, and may drill down into the underlying code from there. (It's drag & drop composition of software, like Bret Victor's "Drawing Dynamic Visualizations", but with functions & data instead of graphical shapes). I expect both models to "meet" at some point in the middle.

I fully agree with the need to implement a system at the lowest level possible, but I've started in JavaScript because it will give me a fast POC, and because I believe that the code within such a system MUST be homoiconic, like Lisp. (JavaScript is not, but it gives me ad-hoc lists and objects for free). Plus, I can just pop open any browser and BOOM. But yes, ultimately I want a system to run on the metal.

There is more I could say, but let's find a better place to collaborate first

Following the announcement that the VPRI FONC list would be discontinued,  some of you expressed interest in collaborating related projects & ideas.

To that end (and in response to some further discussion I've had with some of you), I've created the following GitHub project as a place to collect & document various ideas, concepts, goals, resources, and projects:

https://github.com/d-cook/SomethingNew

The idea is to combine our thoughts, efforts, and resources in the hopes of either (1) finding a common goal/project and collaborating to make something better than an individual effort would yield, and/or (2) supplementing our own individual pursuits by building on each other's ideas and works. One main idea is to explore multiple avenues (projects) at once, rather than trying to find or define "the one best way". This applies both to separate projects or ideas, and exploring (branching) common projects / ideas to explore multiple possibilities.

Currently, the content is rather sloppy and comes from scraping thoughts & goals from some discussion I've had here, and from my own project(s); but I plan to refine it (my aim to is to "get it all out there" first, and then refine it into smaller more coherent main ideas later). I plan to add a bunch of links to related resources shortly, so watch for that. ANYONE IS WELCOME TO FREELY CONTRIBUTE. Since it's a GitHub "project", it has history of all changes, so should the case arise that we disagree with the format or content, we can always review and discuss it; and I mention this as a way to encourage you to be fearless in adding or refining anything present.

I have high hopes for what we can achieve & share together, and for this GitHub project page as a more transparent & clear way (moreso than an email list) to do that.

Not sure if relevant, but a few things I had worked on in the past few years.

I have ended up focusing a lot more on the technical side of things than the user-facing side of things, so, yeah, maybe not all that relevant.

BGBTech2: ... a 3D engine ...
<br/>https://cr88192.github.io/bgbtech_html/deeptail0.html

BGBScript2: a language originally meant for some personal embedded/robot projects ...
<br/>https://github.com/cr88192/bgbtech_engine2/wiki/BGBScript2-1

(I have some robotics stuff, but would prefer to keep a lot of this code private, and the code isn't likely to be terribly useful).

Codecs: BTIC1H and BTIC4B, mostly low-complexity image/video codecs ...

BGBCC: ... an old C compiler of mine ... a previous version targeted a VM used in my robot projects (which BGBScript2 was intended to replace) ...

BJX1: ... sort of a custom ISA, mostly based on an extended form of the SH4 ISA (Hitachi SuperH)
<br/>https://github.com/cr88192/bgbtech_shxemu/wiki/SH-BJX1-ISA
<br/>https://github.com/cr88192/bgbtech_shxemu/wiki/BJX1_IsaDesc

...

Would be nice is CPUs were more open though, like if there were more freedom for people to tinker and customize stuff (vs always treating them as black boxes controlled by some central authority).

There is also RISC-V, which seems promising, but I haven't looked into it all that too deeply.

...

... It is pretty awesome that you're making custom hardware to solve software problems, so thanks for sharing!

Anyway, **while I do want to be liberal about what is shared, I want to limit it to reinventing software (and hardware) to enable fundamentally new ways of thinking and doing**; the computer revolution that "hasn't happened yet", as Kay says. (TODO: Need to add a similar statement to the SomethingNew readme)

However, it might be beneficial to see everyone's past/present projects. I wonder if it would be beneficial to create somewhat of a profile page (or link to one) for each person, even if very informal and brief (e.g. stated interest, experience, and list of projects or whatever). ... though perhaps that's redundant, since we can already view each other's github accounts to see bio & personal projects. But maybe that's also not the same; but I do want to keep the collaboration material related to the main (or related) initiative(s).

Hi all,

Joel had some good questions about this collaboration and the "SomethingNew" GitHub project, and since our discussion was quite relevant, I'm sharing it (with his permission) with the rest of you, below:

[Dan] That's a great looking Blog; and I'm very interested in what you have to say (assuming that's all yours?) in that "Language isn't everything" entry (will read later). **I think it's great for anyone to keep up their own personal stuff (projects, blogs, etc.), and we can talk about the best way to link to our personal stuff**. Perhaps it would be good to create a new page with links to forum topics or blogs (or blog entries) that are relevant, or upon which we are discussion some of these things. And/or maybe we can create an ad-hoc forum (a folder, and each file in it being an ongoing discussion. The change-history will show who contributed what & when, and any edits)

[Dan] As to be a Fonc successor ... I guess that's arguably true. I mean, the mail-list is certainly where the people are originating from; but whether it's "that" or a different "thing" that was spurred from it ... I don't know which is technically accurate, or what we should or should not claim (I mean, I am not Fonc or VPRI; but arguable "we" are? I don't know) ... But whatever, it is what it is, and I just care about making this current thing a "thing". Maybe it's best to not claim another other than that we came together from the Fonc mailing-list.

> [Joel] By the way, I worry about accidental plagiarism on my part, which is one

[Dan] It's not silly to worry about that in general; but yes, **my main goal is to make things happen, and sharing openly is the best (and perhaps only) way to get something big and meaningful to happen** (I actually made a statement about this on my very first post on the topic at Cemetech: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11080). We can worry about legal stuff if this goes anywhere big, and even then I'd prefer to make that bubble as inclusive as makes sense. But I think we are a long ways out from that point, and until then, I hope we can all feel free to borrow & share liberally from each other to the end of making something work.

[Dan] Fresh out of University ... Excellent! That means (1) You are the right person for this, if you're this interested/involved at this point (nice blog!), and (2) Less preconcieved ideas or stuff that you have to unlearn. I tell you, it's been a pain (and almost a lost cause) to try to discuss any truly "new" stuff with any of my more seasoned (I'm a Software Engineer of 5 years now), because they've already got it "figured out", or are content with their perception of their field, and not interested in challenging it.

> [Joel] Finally, we might want to think about a name for the mission as a whole,
> for convenience. Like FoNC. No ideas from me yet though.

[Dan] Maybe. I don't know how I feel about claiming to be "Fonc" (though it's discontinued). "Worse is Better", so I just called it something at all (SomethingNew) ... If this goes anywhere meaningful, this will be something more important to discuss. 

> [Joel] Once again, thanks for taking the initiative here. I look forward to being
> a part of this; it feels extremely important, though sadly unknown.

[Dan] Hopefully, we can work together to convert a lot of thinking into doing. Though an explosion of thought is probably on the menu to start with (and going forward), and that's one of the main goals. Let's see what our combined heads can do to find the "pink plane" (and "pink thoughts") as possible (see ... almost any of Alan Kay's videos on YouTube for the reference. Look for "New" vs "News").

Dan,

In the past there have been projects that have attracted people with
similar ideas and ended up with interesting discussions even if the
groups efforts were never combined into a single project. That was
certainly the case for Tunes OS, which is still a source of related
information:

http://tunes.org/cliki/

A wiki or a shared document on Github is a great way to accumulate
information in a way that can be accessed by new people joining the
project, but it should be complemented by a mailing list or something
like Slashdot or Hacker News, with the best example being:

http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/
