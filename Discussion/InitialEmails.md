Dear "fonc" community,

This is to notify you that this mailing list ("fonc") will be retired and made inactive at the end of this month.
<br/>VPRIs focus and efforts have shifted and we will no longer host or support this list.
<br/>Thanks for your past interest, support and participation.

No, sorry…..I suppose if someone in the community wanted to start something up they’d be more than welcome.  Activity had dropped to almost nothing in the past year…..

Brilliant, thank you Kenny!

Kim, is there a similar way to keep in touch with the latest developments of VPRI and HARC?

You leave the rather intriguing comment that

What have the focus and efforts of VPRI shifted to? Is this related to the
<br/>completion of the STEPS project or is that old news?

I only found out about FoNC, VPRI, heck even the untold story of OOP, less
<br/>than a year ago, and the stuff you're all working on is incredible. It's
<br/>pretty criminal how little-known it is, but I joined because I believe in
<br/>what you're doing and want to see what's going on.

It's a shame that there's not been much activity in 2016 and 17 - but from
<br/>my limited expeditions into the depths of the archives, there seems to be
<br/>a real wealth of useful info that isn't present anywhere else. So huge
<br/>thanks to Kenny Friedman for setting up the new list and archive mirror;
<br/>it'd be a bit sad to join a group just as it's about to disband! :)

There will be some more news in the near future, but I can tell you
<br/>that many of us moved to a Lab called Communications Design Group and
<br/>then to HARC at Y Combinator Research.  Yes, the focus had shifted
<br/>that these points.

The web home is: http://harc.ycr.org  The set of researchers
<br/>is impressive and interesting.  I'm familiar with the GP
<br/>project, and several others are worth of a deeper looker.
<br/>I'm especially interested in the tutoring system.

Hi all,

Over the last 4 years, I too have stumbled upon "the untold story of oop", VPRI, and a number of other "untold" histories of software and efforts to make it more open-ended & human-oriented. I can tell you that FONC is not the only attempt at such a thing.

If I'm not the only one, maybe we can benefit from sharing what we've found (or collaborate on projects or ideas or resources), rather than just limiting to the COLA stuff.

I myself have taken from many sources (like the ones listed below) to develop my own user-oriented software innovation

Is anyone interested?

Examples:
- Intentional Domain Workbench,
- Meta Programming System,
- Lively Kernel,
- https://youtu.be/1O8PwkXfDJg
- (and the following are all on worrydream.com)
  - The Humane Representation of Thought,
  - Drawing Dynamic Visualizations,
  - Learnable Programming

Interested? Absolutely. I recognise the Lively Kernel, and I found Bret
<br/>Victor shortly after discovering this place. But I hadn't come across the
<br/>other things you mentioned; thanks for those.

I was really pleased to see the Apparatus Editor thing (aprt.us) at the
<br/>HARC website. Previously, it was really frustrating that Bret Victor's
<br/>array of magic tools existed only in his talks, but now there is an online
<br/>implementation to play with and study. And the rest of the projects seem
<br/>to be the continuation of several VPRI threads, which is reassuring to
<br/>see.

I agree with you about discussing more than just the COLAs. Are there
<br/>rules for the discussion group about what the focus is? (I haven't
<br/>participated in a mailing list before, so I apologise if I'm making rookie
<br/>mistakes as to the form or content of my replies - please tell me if
<br/>anything's wrong!)

> I can tell you that FONC is not the only attempt at such a thing.

VPRI, or soon-to-be HARC, does seem to be the only organised body of
<br/>people working on this stuff though - I assume that's what you were
<br/>talking about? What little else I've seen is the work of individuals like
<br/>Bret Victor, or the person in the talk you linked to.

By the way, I think I must have come across your GitHub account a few
<br/>weeks ago - I was looking at https://github.com/d-cook/Objects, and I've
<br/>been feeling the urge to do something similar. I think I have the same end
<br/>goal (don't we all), but instead of bootstrapping from JavaScript, I want
<br/>to start with an empty OS process, and hopefully have some sort of
<br/>self-modifying visual editor.

In the same way that the Piumarta and Warth devised the Id object model to
<br/>be the 'minimal' generator, so to speak, of an OO system, why not consider
<br/>the question of what the minimal generator for *direct manipulation* would
<br/>look like - in contrast to the traditional boostrapping method of
<br/>developing textual languages. I want to *begin* with direct manipulation
<br/>of memory and machine instructions, as early as possible -  rather than
<br/>starting with textual programming languages and parsing, adding direct
<br/>manipulation later.  I'd just find it more pleasant to implement the
<br/>object model in a more visually-aided way. What do you think?

Finally, I just wanted to mention the ominous message on the FONC wiki:

> We are faced with a need for significant action and the odds are stacked
> against us. Invention receives no attention, and innovation (even when
> incorrectly understood) receives lip service in the press but no
> current-day vehicle exists to to nurture it.

I suppose I can always go back to this whenever I need a chill down the
<br/>spine and a sense of pressing urgency in life! Anyone else wonder if, at
<br/>some point in the future, society will be so dependent on computer
<br/>software ... that some random null pointer dereference will bring down the
<br/>entirety of civilisation?

First things first: I suggest we find a place to host collaborative materials and discussion. It's probably more important to have somewhere soon than to have somewhat perfect (we can fix that later)

Siggestions:
- google hangouts
- google groups
- github
- cemetech.net (might seem like an odd target community, but there are many creative minds there, exploring all kinds of topics)

One thing I'd like is a list of goals, motivations, and means or mechanisms, and from there we can see where our ideas & materials overlap or differ, and perhaps refine how to approach these things better. Also of value may be what else we can do to promote new ideas and ways of thinking (& doing) in the larger community (industry, education, organizations). I've been trying to promote a subset of ideas at work, but it's hard for most developers to think outside of their mechanical (rather than humanistic) view of software. I'm having some luck appealing to the User Experience (UX) team though, so we'll see where that goes.

In response to some questions I've had:

I agree about promoting the user model above (or instead of) a textual one. My bootstrap approach is a means to create an underlying execution model that could change itself and later be subsumed by a UI. I was going to forego parsing and a REPL and just "brute force" a UI that will allow further development to be done visually; but since I'm starting with code, I'm having a hard time feeling like those things wouldn't make my life easier just to GET to that point.

On the other hand, I've found an applicable reason for such a tool at work, for which I'm STARTING with the UI, and may drill down into the underlying code from there. (It's drag & drop composition of software, like Bret Victor's "Drawing Dynamic Visualizations", but with functions & data instead of graphical shapes). I expect both models to "meet" at some point in the middle.

I fully agree with the need to implement a system at the lowest level possible, but I've started in JavaScript because it will give me a fast POC, and because I believe that the code within such a system MUST be homoiconic, like Lisp. (JavaScript is not, but it gives me ad-hoc lists and objects for free). Plus, I can just pop open any browser and BOOM. But yes, ultimately I want a system to run on the metal.

There is more I could say, but let's find a better place to collaborate first
