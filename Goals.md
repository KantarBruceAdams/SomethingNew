**List of relevent goals for this collaboration and/or its projects**

*(TODO: Add goals gathered from materials listed in Resources.md)*

These are things we wish to accomplish with this (and related) project(s), or principles that we should follow to accomplish our goals.

* Build a collection of relevent resources, goals, concepts, projects, etc.
* Explore multiple ideas & projects in parallel, rather than deciding on any single "way" or solution
* Create a tool or means to make software (programs & data) fluid and more user-oriented
* Recognize where existing tools (e.g. languages & IDEs) do much work to solve artificial problems, and avoid those problems
* Software that is more intuitive and human oriented to build, edit, and use
* Demonstration over rigorous explanation
  * Software itself should follow this principle, both in how "code" is represented/viewed/edited, and how it behaves from an end-user perspective
* Create simpler "stepping-stone" tools to help get to (or explore and discover/identify) the "next level"
  * Exploring many avenues relates to this
* Gather as much information as possible (stand on the shoulders of giants)
* Breaking new ground versus making a "better version" of something that already exists (New vs News)
* Ad-hoc "clay-like" manipulation & creation of software & data by the end user through a UI, versus traditional coding.
* Break away from any "set-in-stone" tool by making tools that are their own live-editors
  * Such a system has to be composed (or mappable to/from) the kind of data / blocks that it is an editor for.
  * Ian Piumarta's "Creme Brulee" analogy
