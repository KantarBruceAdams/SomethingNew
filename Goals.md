**List of relevent goals for this collaboration and/or its projects**

These are things we wish to accomplish with this (and related) project(s), or principles that we should follow to accomplish our goals.

* Build a collection of relevent resources, goals, concepts, projects, etc.
* Explore multiple ideas & projects in parallel, rather than deciding on any single "way" or solution
* Create a tool or means to make software (programs & data) fluid and more user-oriented
* Recognize where existing tools (e.g. languages & IDEs) do much work to solve artificial problems, and avoid those problems
* Software that is more intuitive and human oriented to build, edit, and use
* Demonstration over rigorous explanation
  * Software itself should follow this principle, both in how "code" is represented/viewed/edited, and how it behaves from an end-user perspective
* Create simpler "stepping-stone" tools to help get to (or explore and discover/identify) the "next level"
  * Exploring many avenues relates to this
* Gather as much information as possible (stand on the shoulders of giants)
* Breaking new ground versus making a "better version" of something that already exists (New vs News)
